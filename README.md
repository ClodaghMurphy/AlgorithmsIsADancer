# AlgorithmsIsADancer
Project submitted for Computational Thinking With Algorithms Module 2020
* This project contains text file that introduces key concepts of sorting and explores five sorting algorithms with diagrams and examples. I have illustrated the results of the benchmarking process with data visualisations and discussed the differences between the performance of the sorting algorithms.
* The second item is PythonApp.py which contains implementations of the five sorting algorithms, along with a main method which tests each of them and automatically outputs tables and graphs.  This file can be opened on your preferred command line interface.
